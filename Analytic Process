Data Deep Dive

- Train data is 1460 x 79

Features

- Id column is just row number and can be removed
- All the grading (Excellent, Average, ...) will have high bias
- MSZoning is a categorical variable - no NAs. Moving from rural to residential causes the price of the same property to be higher - https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.rba.gov.au%2Fpublications%2Frdp%2F2018%2Fpdf%2Frdp2018-03.pdf
- LotFrontage is a numerical variable - has NAs. Figure out how to handle NAs?
- Street is a categorical variable - no NAs. Check if "Pave" has more value than "Grav"?
- Alley is a categorical variable - no NAs. NAs mean that no alley access. Most houses don't have alley access. Check if alley access will have higher price? High bias
- Utilities is a categorical variable - no NAs. Do one hot encoding with "AllPub" as 0 rest all as one, since 99% is "AllPub"?  Should remove as 99% is one category of possible four? I vote for remove because of high bias
- Condtion2 is a categorical variable - no NAs. Highly biased to "Norm"
- YearBuilt - will the price decrease with year or no? - will subtract from current year, bin it and make it categorical
- BldgType & HouseStyle seem to be derived from MSSubClass - see which ones to drop
- Remodelled or no? Can be derived from YearBuilt & YearRemodAdd

Derived Variables

- Age of whole house from YrSold - YearBuilt/YearRemodAdd(Whichever is later)
- Age of remodeling from YrSold - YearRemodAdd
  - Row number 523 is negative. It could be a case where the remodelling was promised at time of sale and done after or house bought and renovated
    by owners themselves. Setting all negative to 0.
- Remove LowQualFinSF and YrSold from categorical Variables
